RNTextStatistics
===

This project is an Objective-C port of Dave Child's awesome [Text-Statistics](https://github.com/DaveChild/Text-Statistics) project. More information about readability tests can be found [here](http://plainlanguage.com/newreadability.html).

## Installation ##

The preferred method of installation is through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). Just add the following to your Podfile:

```
pod 'RNTextStatistics', '~> 1.0.0'
```

Or if you want to install manually, simply drag the RNTextStatistics folder into your project. Then import *only* the RNTextStatistics category on NSString into either individual files or your Prefix Header.

``` objective-c
#import "NSString+RNTextStatistics.h"
```

## Usage ##

All readability tests and statistics caluclations are available simple as Categories on NSString which means you can just call them on a string. There is nothing fancy going on here.

``` objective-c
- (float)fleschKincaidReadingEase;
- (float)fleschKincaidGradeLevel;
- (float)gunningFogScore;
- (float)colemanLiauIndex;
- (float)smogIndex;
- (float)automatedReadabilityIndex;
```

##### Example #####

``` objective-c
NSString *raw = @"Quam Nullam Fermentum Cras Ornare";
float fleschEase = [raw fleschKincaidReadingEase];  // 49.48
```

Super simple.

## Unit Tests ##

There is a small suite of unit tests included in the example. The tests are not exhaustive, only there to prove that existing functionality is unchanged after updates and pull requests. I will not accept any pull requests without adequate unit tests.
